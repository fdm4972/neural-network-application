# neural-network-application
this R code provides an example of application of Neural Network. This example is based on one of my research objective, i.e., auto calibration to find the best model parameter values. 
this code includes 2 steps: 1, Neural Network training using the available data, i.e., calibration results using HRR model; 2, application, that is, using the developed relationship from the training step to simulate the calibration process and produce the results of objective function, then select the best parameter set based on the objective function values
